# What is Colony?

Colony is a bare metal provisioner and data center infrastructure management system. It's a cloud native microservice ecosystem with some components hosted in Konstruct and other components that run in your data centers.

Colony provides you a way to easily manage bare metal OS provisioning and deprovisioning operations in your own data centers.
