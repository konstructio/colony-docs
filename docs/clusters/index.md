# Clusters

One possibility for the machines discovered by colony is to be able to create new clusters. For now, we only support the CivoStack, but more options will be available in the future. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let us know in the `#colony-clusters` channel in our [Slack community](https://kubefirst.io/slack).

## CivoStack

TBD, waiting to finish the initial docs.
