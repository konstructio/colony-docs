# Templates

One thing you can do with the machines discovered by colony is to use one of our available templates to install a specific operating system easily on one or multiples machines. For now we support [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev), and [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com), but more templates will be added soon. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let us know in the `#colony-templates` channel in our [Slack community](https://kubefirst.io/slack).

## Talos Linux

TBD, waiting for it to work from the UI.

## Ubuntu
