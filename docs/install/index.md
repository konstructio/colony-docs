## Get Started

If you're new to Colony we recommend checking out the [Overview](/docs/index.md) to learn more.

Keep at eye out for our future releases. If you want to learn more [join our Slack Community](https://konstructio.slack.com/)!

## How do I try Colony?

Right now the easiest way to get started with Colony is by deploying, or [exploring a virtual install in a blog we wrote here](https://blog.konstruct.io/virtual-data-center/).

After you complete the initial set up, you can use Colony to discover your assets and provision a cluster.

## I'm ready to put Colony in to production

If you're ready to get started with Colony today, check out [Deploying Colony](../install/colony-prod/).
